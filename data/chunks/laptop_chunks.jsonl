The display is not ips( not said so in any where, customer care said it is full hd led display) ,but still has good viewing angles.the color calibration is also very good,this with antiglare coating makes it attractable. Battery is 54whr ,said by the customer care,will be updated by me in one month,is performing good and i am expecting 6-7 or above hours of battery life. Brought it for my sister,for collage use. Premium design, fingerprint sensor is there. Charger is included and compact( like a 80w charger from one plus - size). The charger cable is 1.5m long ( apprx). Setting up and using for 1 hr( totaly 2hrs apprx) ,the device never overheated or cranked up the fan. So overall very good product from samsung. Was confused because of absence of the product in the official site,but customer care was very helpful and said that they will update it in the site.i3 1315u is in par with i5 1215u ( in benchmarks) so no worries there( as some may feel that you get i5 for this price,why going for i3: generations do matter).

Since, it is a I3, people will think this may be a big drawback, but trust me, it cannot be, I3 13th Gen is a fast enough Hardware that can get your daily work in seconds. The built quality, display, keyboard typing experience, large trackpad, the HDR plus (manual) and everything is just so perfect, that every drop of money is worth it. There cannot be a better built product in this 35-38k price range.The book4 with i5 or i7 or core 5 or core 7, it is the same in terms of entire quality except the processor, but the positive sign is that the battery for the processor also lasts long enough. The laptop is so well optimized, and you can tell by the products I have, all sync so well and without lag.I basically use the laptop for browsing a lot and drafting and as I am a Lawyer, I have this office use of this laptop at all times, nonetheless, with the seamless sync connectivity throughout the galaxy devices. Its lightning fast, and the feel of using it, is so premium that no one ever can tell that it's a 35-38k segment laptop.  Display 15.6 inch is so compact and bezels are also so thin, and the keyboard click sound is so satisfying and that is the reason I am typing so much here. i was a mac M1 user and due to all the galaxy devices, I switched to windows and as such, brought this Galaxy book and trust me when I say this, this laptop is way beyond my expectations.So you are going to get all the experience of around 50k in this small budget.However, you cannot get a 100 percent perfect piece in this price range. as such the 4-star rating. The main cons are that the speaker is bottom firing and sound is not that loud enough as per the standards in other laptop incl. "

And the Camera is so poor, I don't know why Samsung has given disgusting camera, I think they dumped their oldest stock of camera in this laptop and the weight is also on the higher side, when you lift it, you will feel the weight and the weight distribution is also not that good. the edges are bit sharp, but you will get used to it.Overall, 4 stars for such a premium feel in this price range and galaxy connectivity. Wow, it takes time getting used to, but kudos.\r\n\r\n**Review's Likes**: 57\r\n**Review's Dislikes**: 14\r\n"

Need to buy after trail period.Speaker sounds very low. It's comes with UHD Intel graphics. But in Flipkart product specs it's showing intel iris xe graphics.This laptop comes under notebook 4 series but specs are same like Galaxy Book3  NP754XFG-KB3IN . Only difference is display size. If you are looking a laptop for study purpose highly recommend this.
