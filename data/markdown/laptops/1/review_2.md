### Review's Title: Worth the money

**Review's Content**:
Battery backup is low but okay for a gaming laptop of this capacity. Performance is top-notch and better than any other laptop, with no heating issues like Intel H series. I'd recommend Ryzen over Intel, and the display and speakers are also good.
