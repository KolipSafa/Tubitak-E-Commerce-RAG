### Review's Title: Good quality product

**Review's Rating of the Laptop**: 4

**Review's Content**:
Having used this device for about 10 days, the difference between a smartphone and a laptop gets even more blurred! This is not a power workhorse machine and it is not designed to be one. But it sure is a great asset for simple daily activities such as surfing, emailing and some conferencing from home. Display is so-so and hence if that is important for you, then advise to go for a higher end laptop. But for this price point this is a very good buy. If you need the experience of your Android device on a laptop interface then just go for it. And BTW, Chrome OS is pretty slick so no cribs. Will continue to test and give an updated feedback.
