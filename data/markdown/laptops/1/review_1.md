### Review's Title: Super!

**Review's Content**:
I like the premium feel of the keyboard, display, and design. It performs well in games like Valorent with high settings (250-300fps). The sound quality is good. However, it has a short battery life (1.2hr) after full charging and lacks Microsoft Office access.
