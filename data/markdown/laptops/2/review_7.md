### Review's Title: Highly recommended

**Review's Content**:
Pros :Intel core i3 13th gen - Superb performance and booting within seconds.Display - Cristal Clear display.Design - Metallic body, Very slim and light weight. Feels like a premium laptop.Battery - Fast charging  and good battery backup. C type charger.Samsung applications and Bixby support is there.Cons : Trail version McAfee antivirus. Need to buy after trail period.Speaker sounds very low. It's comes with UHD Intel graphics. But in Flipkart product specs it's showing intel iris xe graphics.This laptop comes under notebook 4 series but specs are same like Galaxy Book3  NP754XFG-KB3IN . Only difference is display size. If you are looking a laptop for study purpose highly recommend this. Not preferable for gaming and heavy work loads like rendering, Editings .This is an intel 13th gen entry level laptop.
