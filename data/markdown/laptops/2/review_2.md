### Review's Title: Simply awesome

**Review's Content**:
This is a genuine samsung product ( i confirmed that with customer care). The display is not ips( not said so in any where, customer care said it is full hd led display) ,but still has good viewing angles.the color calibration is also very good,this with antiglare coating makes it attractable. Battery is 54whr ,said by the customer care,will be updated by me in one month,is performing good and i am expecting 6-7 or above hours of battery life. Brought it for my sister,for collage use. Premium design, fingerprint sensor is there. Charger is included and compact( like a 80w charger from one plus - size). The charger cable is 1.5m long ( apprx). Setting up and using for 1 hr( totaly 2hrs apprx) ,the device never overheated or cranked up the fan. So overall very good product from samsung. Was confused because of absence of the product in the official site,but customer care was very helpful and said that they will update it in the site.i3 1315u is in par with i5 1215u ( in benchmarks) so no worries there( as some may feel that you get i5 for this price,why going for i3: generations do matter). Got it for 38k ,worth it
