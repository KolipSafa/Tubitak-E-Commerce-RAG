### Review's Title: Good choice

**Review's Rating of the Laptop**: 4

**Review's Content**:
Product is good and decent. It is completely value for money. Like there are a lot of things where the company cuts the price. For example Speakers, Display, Keyboard. Speaker is just speaker no base or high volume. Display is also Not very good not very bad and Keyboard is like decent there is no backlight keyboard and Alphabets or number on keys are also like simple white coloured Sticker. I mean this laptop is totally worth it with the cost. If you want to use it like simple meetings, Office, typing, Classes or some normal coding. It is best for it for it Cost.
