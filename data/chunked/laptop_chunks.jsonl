This is not a power workhorse machine and it is not designed to be one. But it sure is a great asset for simple daily activities such as surfing, emailing and some conferencing from home. Display is so-so and hence if that is important for you, then advise to go for a higher end laptop. But for this price point this is a very good buy. If you need the experience of your Android device on a laptop interface then just go for it. And BTW, Chrome OS is pretty slick so no cribs. Will continue to test and give an updated feedback.\r\n\r\n**Review's Likes**: 665\r\n**Review's Dislikes**: 129\r\n"

Touchpad is also great. Boots in seconds. It has a port for USB type-A where you should be able to insert a harddisk/pendrive or any USB device, but unfortunately you'll have to do that forcefully as the port is very tigh/small for those devices. It has a USB type-C port, a 3.5 mm audio jack and a slot for memory card. I have used it for around 9 hours and approx. 50% battery is used. It has 64 GB RAM, the OS occupies ~17 GB of it. Apps like Google docs, slides, sheets, photos, Gmail, YouTube music, etc are pre-installed (though don't work great). Any app that is available on the playstore can be installed on Chrome OS (many of the apps are designed for the phone's or tablets, so might not look good on Chromebooks). You can activate Linux (beta) if you want so (have to dedicate some disk space to that as well). You can expand the memory upto 256 GB using a memory card.  The screen's brightness is good for indoors. The laptop weighs just more than a kg and light, but should be lighter according to its small body. You get OS and security updates up to 2028.Overall it's a good buy.\r\n\r\n**Review's Likes**: 361\r\n**Review's Dislikes**: 104\r\n"

Online classes , Zoom meetings, browsing and the reason is because of its portability,  excellent battery life but the camera quality is just average for video conferences. 2. You may not get the best typing experience but better than many windows devices which is almost twice the price.3. Chrome OS is light weight and also supports Android Apps. Google will definitely comes with better desktop experience in future. It also providing updates till 20284. Build quality is fine for the price rangeDown sides1. Display is not good and maybe because of price range.2. Sound is OK Overall, if you want a device to do simple tasks go for it\r\n\r\n**Review's Likes**: 586\r\n**Review's Dislikes**: 216\r\n"
