Since I have a Galaxy S23, Tab S9 FE Plus, Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, and Galaxy Buds, I had no other options than this Galaxy Book. With all my stated products, everyone can now easily guess that I have everything on a budget price. As such, I had no other options rather than the i3 variant.\n\nComing to the laptop - the only difference is the processor in all the Book 4 variants, and it's the cheapest one. But the laptop itself is not comparable to any other machines out there. Since it's an i3, people will think this may be a big drawback, but trust me, the i3 13th Gen is fast enough hardware that can get your daily work in seconds. The built quality, display, keyboard typing experience, large trackpad, HDR+, and everything is just so perfect that every drop of money is worth it. There cannot be a better-built product in this 35-38k price range.\n\nThe Book 4 with i5 or i7 or Core i5 or Core i7 is the same in terms of entire quality except for the processor, but the positive sign is that the battery for the processor also lasts long enough. The laptop is so well optimized, and you can tell by the products I have, all sync so well without lag.\n\nI basically use the laptop for browsing a lot and drafting as I am a lawyer, and I have this office use of this laptop at all times, nonetheless, with the seamless sync connectivity throughout the Galaxy devices. It's lightning fast, and the feel of using it is so premium that no one ever can tell that it's a 35-38k segment laptop.\n\nThe display is 15.6 inches, compact, and bezels are also thin, and the keyboard click sound is so satisfying. I was a Mac M1 user and due to all the Galaxy devices, I switched to Windows and as such, brought this Galaxy book and trust me when I say this, this laptop is way beyond my expectations.\n\nSo, you're going to get all the experience of around 50k in this small budget. However, you cannot get a 100 percent perfect piece in this price range. As such, I'm giving it 4 stars. The main cons are that the speaker is bottom-firing and sound is not that loud enough as per the standards in other laptops, including my previous Mac M1, but it gets the job done with Dolby Atmos activated.\n\nHowever, the bottom-firing speakers are outdated, and it only works well on flat surfaces; otherwise, you have to place a small object to keep the laptop lifted for better experience. The camera is also poor - I don't know why Samsung has given such a terrible camera, which seems like they dumped their oldest stock of camera in this laptop.\n\nThe weight is also on the higher side when you lift it, and the weight distribution is not that good. The edges are bit sharp, but you will get used to it. Overall, I'm giving 4 stars for such a premium feel in this price range and Galaxy connectivity. Wow, it takes time getting used to, but kudos!"
