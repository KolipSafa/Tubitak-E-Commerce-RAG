The color calibration is also very good, and this, combined with the anti-glare coating, makes it attractive. The battery is 54Whr, according to customer care, and I expect it to perform well, potentially providing 6-7 hours or more of battery life. I purchased it for my sister for her college use. The premium design features a fingerprint sensor. The charger is included and compact, similar in size to an 80W charger from OnePlus. The charger cable is approximately 1.5 meters long. After setting up and using the device for about an hour (totaling around two hours), it never overheated or started the fan. Overall, this is a very good product from Samsung. I was initially confused by its absence from the official site, but customer care was helpful, stating that they will update the site soon. The i3-1315U processor performs similarly to an i5-1215U in benchmarks, so there's no need to worry about it being inferior (as some may assume when comparing prices). I purchased it for 38,000 and consider it worth it."
