    "content": "I love the product, but I recently had to change my display, idk how it happened maybe due to ram or motherboard malfunction, it was the 4th day of using the laptop , i hope Asus Team put that it note plus need to give better cushioning on the laptop before packaging , as well as Team Flipkart! Since it's a really expensive product, overall I loved the product but it's taking time to repair in the Authorized service centre , hope this feedback helps the other costumers\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb",
